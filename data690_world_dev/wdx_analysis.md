## Introduction

Youth employment participation has been declining for a while now all around the world. When we look at the topic broadly, it may seem as though the world is changing very quickly—tech companies are taking over our daily lives, cultures all over the world are modernizing, etc.—but when we look more closely, we find that there are fewer youth in the workforce than there were in the 2010. It's really stunning, huh? Let's look at what kind of an influence "enrollment in higher-level education" has on the percentage of youth who are in the workforce now that we've dug a little deeper.

## Topics & Indicators
**Secondary education, pupils:** The total number of students enrolled in secondary education in both public and private institutions.

**Labor force participation rate for ages 15-24, total (%) (modeled ILO estimate):** The percentage of the population aged 15 to 24 who are economically active—all those who provide labor for the creation of goods and services over a given time period—is known as the labor force participation rate for this age group.

## Countries under observation
We will consider South Asian countries for our observation:
1. India
2. Pakistan
3. Afganistan
4. Nepal
5. Bhutan
6. Srilanka
7. Bangladesh

## What connection exists between higher education enrolment and labor force participation?
Prior to examining a comparison between the two, let's first take a closer look at youth involvement in the labor force and higher education separately.
