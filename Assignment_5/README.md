# Assignment 5
## Data Analysis with Python
- The youtube video goes into introduction about how to use python in data analysis

**I learned how to use Jupyter notebook and the features that Jupyter notebook offers compared to other python IDE's.**

### Lecture 1 **Introduction**
- The jupyter notebook is very useful for visualization and analysis as we can separate the code into different cells that does not need to be run all at once. 
- So, we can analyze or visualize a specific aspect in the dataset using different cells

### Lecture 2 **Real Life Example of a Python/Pandas Data Analysis project**
- I learned how to use numpy for Algebric functions. We can use numpy to get stats of the dataset.
- I learned how to connect to MySQL using sakila database and use data from db

### Lecture 3: **Jupyter Notebooks Tutorial**
- I learned how to use pandas in data analysis. We can use pandas to create series, dataframes and read csv, xlsx, json, avro, parquet files etc. 
- Pandas dataframes make the complex datasets to be relatively easily analyzed using dataframes without disturing the integrity of the dataset. 
- We can also make a dataset (like csv, xlsx etc files) after analyzing and making sufficient changes using pandas.
- Read data from csv file

### Lecture 4: **Intro to NumPy**
- I learned how to  perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays using Numpy

### Lecture 5: **Intro to Pandas**
- I learned how to use Data sets in Pandas which are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames. 
- Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table.

### Lecture 6: **Data Cleaning**
- I learned how to identify null values in a dataset. 
- I learned how to drop the null values and also how to impute the missing or null data with appropriate data that does skew the dataset in anyway.
- I also learned how to visually show the missing data using matplotlib, KDE (kernel density estimation), Histogram, pie, bar chart, scatter plot etc.

### Lecture 7: **Reading Data from other sources**
- I learned how to read data sets from different sources like json as request
- I learned how to read data sets from relational database, csv, rest-api, text file

### Lecture 8: **Python Recap**
- I learned that Python has a lot of different collections, operators, datatypes, functions, control flows, modules, exceptions etc.
- There are collections like Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets etc. The try except block was very useful in knowing where an error occurs and how to deal with those errors that does not give you a very useful output. 
- The control flow help in making sure that a specific statement or condition is satisfied before continuing to the next aspect. 
- For this I learned If, elif, else, for loops, where loops. 
- I learned different operators like arithmatic and boolean operators. 
- I also how to comment in phyton that does not disturn the code and is useful to keep track of what you are doing and why.
